  Basically I know the struggle I went through just trying to renew my expired Nigerian passport and unfortunately
  for me I was studying in the UK when it expired. I remember having a tough time getting the right information 
  about the process and due to inefficiency of Nigeria's management system it was a mess. I have decided to fully 
  state out the process I went through in renewing mine.
  Instead of complaining about it like everyone I met during my processing period and have decided to briefly
  illustrate the process. Hope you understand every detail.
