    <title>Steps to Renew expired Nigerian Passport in london</title>
    <description>Basically I know the struggle I went through just trying to renew my expired Nigerian passport and unfortunately for me I was studying in the UK when it expired. I remember having a tough time getting the right information  about the process and due to inefficiency of Nigeria&#39;s management system it was a mess. I have decided to fully  state out the process I went through in renewing mine. Instead of complaining about it like everyone I met during my processing period and have decided to briefly illustrate the process. Hope you understand every detail.
